			What is a CTF?  A CTF is an event during which students, teachers, and professionals come together to compete against one another in an effort to test and expand cyber-security skills and awareness.  Participants will be challenged with cyber-security related puzzles from categories like network exploitation, cyber forensics, cryptography, and cyber trivia.  Each challenge hides a unique string called a 'flag' and participants will receive points for each captured flag.
